# Testmusicplayer
I created a mini music player, for study purposes and it was done using Javascript + CSS + HTML, songs are free to download less the first one and also the photos that I will change later.

I'm a brazilian student doing IT college, more studying Front-end, I'm trying to create a web application and better pages.
